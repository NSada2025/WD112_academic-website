This study presents an integrated computational pipeline for biomarker discovery using multi-omics data from cancer patients. Our approach identified several novel biomarkers with potential clinical applications.

## Abstract

We developed an integrative computational framework that combines genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data to identify robust biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Using machine learning algorithms and network analysis, we discovered a panel of biomarkers that showed superior performance in patient stratification.

## Main Findings

- Identified 15 novel biomarker candidates through integrated analysis
- Validated biomarkers in independent cohorts (n=500)
- Achieved 92% accuracy in patient stratification
- Demonstrated clinical utility in treatment selection

## Impact

This work has been cited over 150 times and has led to the development of a clinical diagnostic tool currently in phase II trials.
