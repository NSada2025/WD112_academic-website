# About Me

I am Naoki Sada, M.D., a 3rd year PhD student in the Department of Molecular Neuroscience at Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine. Currently, I am conducting research in the Yamashita laboratory, where I study the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, particularly multiple system atrophy (MSA).

## Research Focus

My current research focuses on understanding the role of chaperone proteins in the cytotoxic and propagative characteristics of protein aggregates in MSA. Through comprehensive omics analysis, I have discovered disruptions in sphingolipid metabolic pathways that may contribute to disease pathogenesis. This work is supported by a JSPS Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (DC1).

Previously, during my undergraduate research, I investigated the role of histone deacetylase (HDAC) in neuronal rewiring following traumatic brain injury, which resulted in a publication in Cell Death & Disease.

## Academic Journey

My path in medicine and neuroscience began at Osaka University Faculty of Medicine, where I earned my M.D. degree in 2021, receiving the prestigious Yamamura Prize for academic excellence. This journey has taken me from clinical training at Osaka University Hospital and Toneyama National Hospital to fundamental research in molecular neuroscience.

A formative experience was my research internship at the University of Liverpool's Barkla X-ray Laboratory of Biophysics, supported by the Kishimoto International Exchange Scholarship, where I gained expertise in protein crystallography and structural biology.

## Beyond Research

I am passionate about translating scientific discoveries into practical medical applications. As a teaching assistant for the Training Program for Medical/Healthcare Device Startup CEOs, I help bridge the gap between research and innovation. My involvement in the Medical Device Design course earned our team recognition for both intellectual property management and business risk management.

I also contribute to evidence-based medicine as a member of the Chronic Lung Disease evidence updating group for the Japan Society for Neonatal Health and Development, where I help establish clinical recommendations based on systematic literature review.

## Recognition & Awards

- JSPS Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (DC1) with Grant-in-Aid (4,400,000 JPY for 3 years)
- Yamamura Prize (graduation honors, top 3 out of 115 graduates)
- Junior Investigator Poster Award, Japan Neuroscience Society
- Pathophysiology Excellence Award, Japanese Association of Anatomists
- Multiple awards for medical device innovation and entrepreneurship

## Contact

I am always interested in discussing research collaborations, particularly in the areas of neurodegeneration, protein aggregation, and translational neuroscience. Please feel free to reach out at naoki.s.sound.of.sil@gmail.com.
