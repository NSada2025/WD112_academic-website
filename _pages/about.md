# About Me

I am Naoki Sada, M.D., a 3rd year PhD student in the Department of Molecular Neuroscience at Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine. Currently, I am conducting research in the Yamashita laboratory, where I study the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases and higher brain functions through the lens of active inference theory.

## Current Research Focus

My research has evolved from molecular mechanisms to systems-level understanding:

1. **Molecular Level**: Protein aggregation and cellular pathology in MSA
2. **Systems Level**: Active inference and predictive processing in brain function
3. **Clinical Translation**: Applying insights to patient care at Toneyama Hospital

This integrative approach allows me to tackle neurodegenerative diseases from multiple perspectives, combining molecular biology, computational neuroscience, and clinical practice.

## Beyond Research

I am passionate about translating scientific discoveries into practical medical applications. As a teaching assistant for the Training Program for Medical/Healthcare Device Startup CEOs, I help bridge the gap between research and innovation. My involvement in the Medical Device Design course earned our team recognition for both intellectual property management and business risk management.

I also contribute to evidence-based medicine as a member of the Chronic Lung Disease evidence updating group for the Japan Society for Neonatal Health and Development, where I help establish clinical recommendations based on systematic literature review.

## Recognition & Awards

- JSPS Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (DC1) with Grant-in-Aid (4,400,000 JPY for 3 years)
- Yamamura Prize (graduation honors, top 3 out of 115 graduates)
- Junior Investigator Poster Award, Japan Neuroscience Society
- Pathophysiology Excellence Award, Japanese Association of Anatomists
- Multiple awards for medical device innovation and entrepreneurship
