  <p class="subtitle">Exploring the molecular basis of neurodegeneration through protein aggregation research</p>
</div>

I am a physician-scientist investigating the fundamental mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases at Osaka University. My research focuses on understanding how protein misfolding and aggregation contribute to neuronal dysfunction, with particular emphasis on Multiple System Atrophy and Huntington's disease.

## Current Work

My doctoral research in the Yamashita laboratory employs a multidisciplinary approach combining proteomics, lipidomics, and computational modeling to uncover the molecular cascades that lead to neurodegeneration. Through comprehensive omics analysis, we have identified critical disruptions in sphingolipid metabolism that may serve as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

## Background

**Medicine & Research** — Osaka University School of Medicine (2015-2021)  
Early research on neuronal plasticity following brain injury, culminating in a publication on HDAC-mediated rewiring mechanisms.

**Clinical Training** — Osaka University Hospital (2021-2023)  
Direct patient care experience that crystallized my commitment to understanding the molecular basis of neurodegenerative diseases.

**Doctoral Studies** — Molecular Neuroscience, Osaka University (2023-present)  
Supported by JSPS Research Fellowship DC1

## Selected Recognition

Yamamura Prize for Academic Excellence  
JSPS Research Fellowship DC1  
International Research Experience at University of Liverpool
