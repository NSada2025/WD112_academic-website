## Abstract
This work demonstrated that inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) following traumatic brain injury promotes neural circuit reorganization through enhanced BDNF expression, leading to significant functional recovery in motor tasks. The study provides mechanistic insights into epigenetic regulation of neural plasticity after brain injury.
